# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Angela Lu

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about Javascript, where we can make anything functional, like a game, making the search button work in the website, and many more. The purpose of this blog is combining what we learn about Javascript and our new tool that we learned on our own, kaboomjs to make a game that is relaxing and helps entertain others. 

## Content
For my project, I am making a adventure game. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying kaboomjs in order to make a adventure game.

## Implications
The adventure game we created is a fun and relaxing game, where you collect different food in order to go to the next level.
