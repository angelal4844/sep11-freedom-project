# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Angela Lu

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about Javascript, where we can make anything functional, like a game, making the search button work in the website, and many more. The purpose of this blog is combining what we learn about Javascript and our new tool that we learned on our own, kaboomjs to make a game that is relaxing and helps entertain others. 

## Content
For my project, I am making a adventure game, where the player needs to collect all the food in each level in order to go to the next level. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying kaboomjs in order to make a adventure game.

## Implications
Our game is an adventure game that we created, where the player collects all the ingredients in each level to go to the next level. People can explore different types of ingredients at each level. For example, cheese, tomato sauce, flour, and many more. Our adventure game is a fun and relaxing game. It can have a huge impact on students because it is a relaxing game where students can learn about different ingredients and create teamwork and collobration. In addition, it is a dun adventure game, where you can play during your free time or when you are bored. My creation helps create jobs in programming because people can use Javascript to create the levels and make the sprite move. In conclusion, it also helps create jobs in art because people can draw the sprites and the background.
