# Entry 3 (Tinkering with kaboomjs (Day3))
##### 2/13/2023

## Context 
These few weeks, I was tinkering with kaboomjs and working on my project that I made using kaboomjs. Last blog, I was loading all the sprite, calling the sprite, and creating a easy level using `addLevel([])` for my game. This blog, I will talk about how I made the sprite interactive.


## Kaboomjs (Day 3) 
* `onKeyPress()` --> 
* `onKeyDown()`--> 
* `onKeyPressReapeat()`--> 
* `onKeyRelease()` --> 
* `onMouseDown()` --> 
* `onMousePress()` --> 
* `const x = rand(0, width())` --> Helps move the sprite in different places horizontally. 
* `const y = rand(0, height())` --> Helps move the sprite in different places vertically.

## Game 
In the beginning, when I was trying to make my sprite interactive, I was really confused what was the difference between `onKeyDown()` and `onKeyPress()`. In addition, I tried it in kaboomjs playground and learned that onkeyDown() helps the sprite go to different directions, while onKeyPress() helps the sprite move anywhere when you click on any keys. 

First, I started making the sprite move in random places.
