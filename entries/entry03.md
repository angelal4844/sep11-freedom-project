# Entry 3 (Tinkering with kaboomjs (Day3))
##### 2/13/2023

## Context 
These few weeks, I was tinkering with kaboomjs and working on my project that I made using kaboomjs. Last blog, I was loading all the sprite, calling the sprite, and creating a easy level using `addLevel([])` for my game. This blog, I will create a hard level and use new components I learned when tinkering with kaboomjs.
