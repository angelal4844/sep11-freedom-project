# Entry 4 (Building my MVP)
##### 3/13/23

### Context
These few days, me and my partner was building and planning out our mvp for our adventure game. We wanted to make a food adventure game, where the sprite finds all the ingredients for the food to complete the level. In this blog, I will walk through my process on planning my MVP as well as building my MVP.

### Planning 
In the beginning, me and partner decided to plan out all the sprite, background and blocks before starting to build the MVP. 
* In the first level, we decided to create a cute background, where the sprite needs to escape from all the wishing glass through finding all the ingredients of a pizza. 

* Ingredients
    * 
    * 


* In the second level, we decided to create a dark background, where the sprite needs to escape from the Queen of spiders through finding all the ingredients for a cake.
