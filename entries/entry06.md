### Context 
These few weeks, we were working on our beyond MVP and starting our expo elevator pitch and In-class presentation. A Expo elevator pitch is when you present your project to the judges in 1 minute. In addition, In-Class presentation is when you present your project in class. Through the journey in the expo elevator pitch and In-class presentation, there were many takeaways and things I could improve on for my future presentations. 

### Beyond MVP 
After we finish builidng the MVP, we started builidng the Beyond MVP. For our beyond MVP, we decided to changed the gravity of the sprite, so that the sprite would not be flying when the sprite jump. 
In the beginning, the gravity was 900. When the sprite jumps, we notice that the sprite was floating and landing on the ground very slow. 
```JS
gravity(900)
```
In addition, we tried increasing the gravity from 900 to 2000. When the sprite jumps, the sprite wasn't floating and it was landing on the ground very fast. 

### Takeaways from doing our freedom project
* Takeaways
    * One takeaway when doing the project were collobration. In semester 1, me and my partner were in the same class, which made it easier to collobrate the work and helping each other in class every Monday on our adventure game. However in semester 2, we were in different classes for SEP, that had made it difficult for us to collobrate together in class. However, through message and working together in lunch, we were able to separate the task and combining the task we did together in lunch. 
<br></br>
    * Another takeaway was using console.log() and tutorials. Using console.log() and tutorials, it had helped us find errors when debugging as well as learning new things. For example, when me and my partner were writing the code for the sprite, we need to write the `pos()`, `scale()`, and `sprite()` for our sprite. 
    
    In Javascript, we use semicolon at the end of each code, but in Kaboomjs, we use comma. In the beginning, we would always use semicolon instead of comma at the end of each code, that gave us a lot of synax errors.
```JS
const player = add([
sprite("sprite-3");
pos(50, 89);
scale(0.05); 
solid();
area();
body();
    ])
```
However, using console.log() and tutorials, it had helped us find the mistake and helped us learned that we need to use comma at the end of each code. 
```JS
const player = add([
sprite("sprite-3"),
pos(50, 89),
scale(0.05), 
solid(),
area(),
body(),
    ])
```

### Expo Elevator Pitch 
* Takeaways 
    * Some takeaways during the expo elevator pitch is showing the code and the preview. 

* Things I need to improve on  
    * More eye contact 

### In-class Presentation 
* Takeaways 
    * Some takeaways during our In-class presentation is praticing the presentation at home. Praticing the presentation at home had helped me feel more confident in what I am going to say during the presentation because I already know what I am going to say. When I first started recording myself presenting my project, I noticed that I was reading the slides the whole time and didn't have any eye contact. In addition, I tried memorizing what I need to say and having more eye contact when I present my project. 

* Things I need to improve on  
    * More eye contact 
    * Speaking more loudly 

### Skills 
Some skills I learned is debugging, communication, and collobration. When

### EDP 

Last blog, I was in stage 5, creating a prototype and stage 6, test and evaluate the prototype. This blog I am in stage 7
